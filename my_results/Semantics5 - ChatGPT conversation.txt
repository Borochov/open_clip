Mission description: we are creating an image understanding test. 
                Given a few true image descriptions we want to generate wrong descriptions for a multiple-choice test. 
                The wrong captions need to not match the original image but to be close enough to be challenging and 
                test the reading comprehension.

*** Model response: ***
For eg
Original image description: A beautiful sunset at the beach with palm trees and waves crashing onto shore.
Wrong descriptions: 
1) A busy cityscape at night with tall skyscrapers and cars honking in the streets.
2) A snowy landscape with mountains and pine trees covered in frost.
3) A tranquil lake in the countryside with blooming wildflowers and ducks swimming.
