Mission description: This is a new task. We are creating an image understanding test.

                    test the reading comprehension.

Yes, I understood the examples. In the first set of captions, the changes were made to the type of bird, its location, and its features such as the beak and eyes. In the second set of captions, the changes were made to the color of the dog, the number of people on the boat, and the location of the boat. These changes are subtle but significant enough to create a descriptive caption that does not accurately reflect the image in the same way.
